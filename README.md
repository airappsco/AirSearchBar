## ðŸš€ Usage

Import module in the file which will be used in
```swift
import AirSearchBar

Initialize the AirSearchBar with the needed parameters

    let airSearchBarViewModel = AirSearchBarViewModel(
        initialDataSource: ["Nebulizer", "Nebulize", "Nebulous", "Nebula"]
    )

        viewModel: airSearchBarViewModel
    )
```

To update the dataSource from view model do the following:
```swift
    .onReceive(airSearchBarViewModel.didSearchKeywordSubject, perform: { keyword in
        if keyword.isEmpty == false {
            airSearchBarViewModel.update(dataSource: ["Star Wars"])
            print("didSearchKeywordPublisher: \(keyword)")
        }
    })
```

To handle the search when finished do the following: 
```swift
    .onReceive(airSearchBarViewModel.didFinishSearchKeywordSubject, perform: { keyword in
        print("didFinishSearchKeywordPublisher: \(keyword)")
    })
```
